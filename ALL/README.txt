These font files (which are excluded from the main repo's license) are needed in a lot of these projects, usually placed at the root of the project's source code directory.

They are modified versions of Bai Jamjuree, a free font from Google Fonts under the Open Font License. You can grab the original unmodified font files at https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bai+Jamjuree.
